## About CacheMiss

Welcome to **CacheMiss** — a blog that _looks like a kernel panic but reads like a stream of consciousness_.

This space lives at `cachemiss.vedantk.xyz`, and it’s where I log ideas, stories, code snippets, and unfinished thoughts. I hope you find something interesting, or at least mildly broken.

You’ll find content on:

- 🖥️ Operating systems, system software, and performance stuff
- 🌐 Web development experiments, frameworks, and tooling rants
- ⚙️ Backend design, databases, and weird bugs
- 🧪 Side projects, hacks, and one-off explorations
- 📚 Notes from what I read, build, or break
- 💭 Ramblings on tech, thinking, and learning

This isn’t a polished tech tutorial blog. It’s a messy buffer of everything that doesn’t fit neatly into categories — the kind of stuff that doesn’t cache well but is still worth writing down.

Thanks for stopping by — hope you find something interesting, or at least mildly broken.

— Vedant Kesarwani
