## Table of contents

## Introduction

**Guten Tag alle!** This is the first post of my blog, which will be hosted on a similar domain as my portfolio. I hope to make this a place to not just share about my yaps and learnings in the tech field, but also to share about something that I just discovered, or did.

## Why Though?

So good question (you haven't asked any question), the main reason to start this blog was to find a way to document parts of my life that I felt needed to be out there.

> Another reason for starting the blog was that I was the writing lead of Keynote in 2024 - 2025 year, and there wasn't much to write then.

Also here I want to document my honours journey, trying to little by little give out some updates on what I have discovered/learned. This is because blockchain is a very new field to me and I want to take you along the journey.

Apart from these, here I would try to feature various web dev and other stuff that I used and started really enjoying. I also want to begin a series on ricing Arch Linux and deleting Windows from my machine, but we'll cross that bridge once we get to it.

> Just you wait till when I start flexing I use Arch btw on every post.

## Let's Begin

I will end this post with let's begin, because that really just feels like the morally correct thing to do. I hope that this dump becomes more than a checklist item ticked off and more of a thing that I actively try to improve, but till then peace out.
